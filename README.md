# Test Assignment Instructions:

Follow these steps to copy the repository, complete the tasks, and deploy the project using Vercel or GitHub Pages:

# 1. Clone the Repository to Your GitHub:

Work on the assignment should be done in your personal GitHub account. Clone the repository to your own GitHub account.

# 2. Complete the Tasks:

Open the cloned project in your preferred code editor and work on the assigned tasks within the project files.
Use Git commands to track your changes:
Add changes: `git add .`
Commit changes: `git commit -m "Describe your changes"`
Push changes: `git push origin <branch-name>`

# 3. Deploy to Vercel or GitHub Pages:

Deploy your project to Vercel or GitHub Pages so the reviewer can assess your work. You may also include a screen recording or GIF demonstrating your project's functionality. Please include your full name in the task submission area to clearly identify your work.

# 4. Submit Two Links for Review:

- Link to your GitHub repository containing the completed assignment.
- Link to your deployed project on Vercel or GitHub Pages, or a screen recording/GIF of the project.

# Below is an example of how it should look:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
